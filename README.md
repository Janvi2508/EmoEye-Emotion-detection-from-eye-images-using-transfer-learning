# EmoEye-Emotion-detection-from-eye-images-using-transfer-learning
EmoEye is a deep learning project designed to classify human emotions using only the eye region of facial images, providing a more privacy-preserving and constrained alternative to full-face emotion recognition. The project explores the effectiveness of four transfer-learning architectures—ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121—trained on cropped eye-region datasets with extensive augmentation. While ResNet50 achieved the highest training accuracy of 76.81%, VGG16 showcased the best generalization on unseen test data, making it the most robust model in real-world scenarios. This repository includes preprocessing steps, model training pipelines, and comparative evaluation to assess how well different CNN architectures perform in limited-visibility emotion detection tasks.
